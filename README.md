# side-projects-summary
I made a list of all my side projects, given that in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessiopiergiacomi) they are lost in the middle of work projects, and in one my one-page resume they just don't fit. (In bold the ones I am more proud of)

* [**Anti-antibot Cloudflare library**](https://github.com/alessiop86/anti-antibot-cloudflare) In August 2016 like every respectable geek I went totally crazy with Pokèmon Go. Weeks before *serious* third party apps emerged I wrote an app on my own for personal use. The Android app is throwaway code, but during the app development I needed to fetch data from a website constantly under anti Cloudflare's DDoS protection, so I wrote this [Java/Android library](https://github.com/alessiop86/anti-antibot-cloudflare). *This is probably the best example on GitHub of the quality of the Java production code I can produce*.

* [**YT-Lyrics**](http://yt-lyrics.appspot.com/en/ytlyrics.html) Bookmarklet that lets the user find with just one click the lyrics of a song from its Youtube video. First version was implemented in 2013 using jQuery + Yahoo YUI JavaScript library, without any backend. Then Youtube forced SSL connection broking the bookmarklet, so i rewrote part of the JavaScript logic in Python and moved the critical part of the business logic from client side to server side (hosted on Google App Engine, free plan).

* [Pokèmon Trainer Club registration script](https://github.com/alessiop86/ptc-registration) Small Python automation script I wrote in August 2016. I have a passion for small automation scripts, at work I had to ask for more personal repositories in my Gitlab enterprise account once I reached the default cap.

* [Jira Formatter Helper](https://github.com/alessiop86/jira-formatter-helper) Our external managed JIRA was not offering formatting functionalities and it was not using the standard Markdown syntax, so I could not even paste the text from Markdown editors into Jira. As I got tired of this, I quickly hacked this page to help me with formatting.

* [**Handy**] Development of a prototype and of a sketch of business model in order to partecipate to the "call for startups" of the LUISS ENLABS accelerator, in a team of 3 people including [Francesco Pugliese](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/francescopugliese77) and [Eleonora Calvi](https://it.linkedin.com/in/eleonora-calvi-007b3843) and 2 minor contributors. Our project regarded the application in a touristic scope of image recognition technologies, executed *locally* on mobile devices (which is a problem solved or almost solved now, but was not so in late 2014/early 2015). * During Handy's development nights I made some small contributions to Open source projects like [this](https://github.com/jetpacapp/DeepBeliefSDK). 

* [Random idea generator](https://github.com/alessiop86/display-random-concepts) One day I was looking for inspiration, so I built this tool that generates a random graph given certain items.

* [**Speech-to-text shopping list for Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alessio.listadellaspesavocale) I developed an application for the volunteer cause I was working with, RetakeRoma. The app of the Volunteer Cause was temporary stopped because they had to find an agreement with the local police about how to handle reports, but in the meanwhile *I was fired up* and I wanted to publish something on the Google Play store at any cost, so I developed in 2 days this very simple App :)

* [Quixplorer Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/alessiop86/quixplorer-upload-eclipse-plugin) A customer forced us to deploy our files to his test environment using an old tool with a browser based interface (quixplorer), but I managed to automate the process writing an IDE plugin that let us upload the files from the IDE.

* [notes](https://github.com/alessiop86/notes) My first and only python desktop app, wrote after I went mad because the cleaning lady accidentally threw away my precious post-it notes.

* [Augmented reality & e-commerce] In early 2010 I partecipated to the Business Plan Competition "eCapital", with a project involving e-commerce and augmented reality. I was the only Software developer in the team, and I built a prototype of the Flash application involving Augmented Reality, displayed by my sister at page 7 of [this document](http://www.ecapital.it/cms/images/BookdelleIdee2011.pdf).

This are just a part of my side projects, *many others have been abandonded at a very early stage*, such as a car rental broker prototype, an Android app to book beach umbrellas, some scripts to scrape football data and do some machine learning stuff with the data in the vain hope of increasing my winning odds in football bets, an Android app to store all the shortcuts of most common used desktop apps, an Android app to keep track of the debts with my friends, and a browser game based on football.

And then there are the others old projects I did when I was very young and I had not met distributed source control systems yet, including several irc war scripts, other mirc scripting cool stuff, a bullettin board in ASP, and probably other projects I can't even remember at the moment.
